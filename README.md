# Active-Magnetic-Compensation-Simulation
We developed a variety of simulation tools in order to understand the behavior of the multidimensional PI control loop at the University of Winnipeg. As will be shown, these simulations were quite successful in describing the system including: the matrix $M$ and its inverse, and the time-dependent response of the PI loop to perturbation.
